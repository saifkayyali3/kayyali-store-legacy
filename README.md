# Kayyali Family Fruits and Veggies Store
## The Story
This was my first "real-world" application, built when I was 11 years old. I wanted to create a digital solution for our family fruit and vegetable business to replace manual price calculations.

## Technical Highlights
Even as a young developer, I focused on:
* **User Interface:** A clean console menu displaying prices in JD.
* **Logic:** Using `switch` statements to handle 12 different product IDs.
* **State Management:** A `while` loop that maintains a running `total` until the user chooses to exit.
### Why this matters
This project taught me the fundamentals of input/output (`iostream`) and how code can solve practical daily problems. It laid the foundation for my current work in Web Development and API integration.

To run this project, you need a C++ compiler (like `g++`).
